# Jobs4Us Webpage README

## Introduction
Welcome to the webpage our team has created. This webpage is a response to the *Muhammadiyah Welfare Home* problem statement. The Welfare home has requested for a web-based Minimart and Voucher System enabling users to request products and earn vouchers while providing administrators with robust management and reporting tools. The webpage created addresses these challenges.

## Overview And Instructions

### Launching the Webpage
The webpage was written in Flutter, an open-source framework from Google that allows developers to build apps for multiple platforms using a single codebase.

To run the webpage, open the jobs4us folder. Ensure that the present working directory `jobs4us`. To check run,
```
pwd
```
in the terminal.

If you are not in the right directory run the line:
```
cd jobs4us
```
in the terminal.


Then run:
```
flutter run
```
The terminal will prompt you to choose a connected device to run the webpage on. Enter a number accordingly.

If you wish to **quit** the programme, enter `q` into the terminal.

### Creating a profile for the Webpage
When you enter the website, you will be brought to the login page. The login page gives you the choice to login as either an *Administrator* or a *Resident*.

As a new user, you will have to create a new account. Click create profile (Take note that you will have to create 2 seperate profiles when logging in as an Admin or a Resident).

You will be prompted to provide your `Name`, `Username`, and a `Password`. Feel free to input anything in these fields. **However**, for the `Phone Number` field,  only input the following phone number,
```
81234567
```
**As this is still a demo page this is the only phone number that works.**

You will be prompted to enter an **OTP**. The OTP is
```
123456
```
You will then be redirected back the the login page (The steps for profile creation for both Admin and Residents are the same).

Proceed to login with the credentials you have inputed.

**Take note that only two accounts (one Resident and one admin) can be made with the provided phone number. Which means that as of now only one person can test the website by logging in with the provided phone number and OTP**

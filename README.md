# Jobs4Us Webpage README

## Introduction
Welcome to the webpage the team consisting of Bernie, Lin Wen, Melody and Vismay has created. This webpage is a response to the *Muhammadiyah Welfare Home* problem statement. The Welfare home has requested for a web-based Minimart and Voucher System enabling users to request products and earn vouchers while providing administrators with robust management and reporting tools. The webpage created addresses these challenges.
